# portfolio

## I did the following steps to complete my portfolio project.
+ Created a HTML structure in HTML file and added `lang` attruibute.
For making my site responsive, added `<meta>` tag alone with`viweport` attribute.
+ Created different areas like header, banner, cars by using semantic tags`header`, `section`.
+ Applied few styles for those elements by using external css (`css/style.css`).
+ Download few  **images** and placed those images in a folder named `images`.
+ Declared those images in `index,html` by using `img` tag along with `src` and `alt`.
